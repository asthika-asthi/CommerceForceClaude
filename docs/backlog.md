# CommerceForce — Live Backlog

Last updated: 2026-07-05. This is the single source of truth for build status.
Bug-review findings and their fix status live in `docs/bugs-log.md`.

## Testing status key

- **Built + Tested** — code committed, manually verified end-to-end
- **Built, not tested** — code committed, NOT manually tested yet; save for one big test session
- **Not built** — no code exists; needs to be built

---

## Built + Tested

### Sprints 1–3
All of Sprints 1–3 were tested before Sprint 4 work began.
Core auth, products, categories, cart, checkout, orders (basic), branding, landing page, and storefront are verified working.

### Product variants (Sprint 8 — 2026-06-26)
Full variant system tested end-to-end via automated pytest suite (123 tests pass) and live API tests:
- Create product → default variant auto-created with matching SKU
- Add option types (Size, Colour) + values (S/M/L, Red/Blue) → generate 6 combinations
- Re-generate is idempotent (previously was a bug, now fixed)
- Variant SKU update, duplicate SKU rejected (409), active/inactive toggle
- Warehouse stock set and queried per variant_id
- Add variant to cart, update quantity, remove; cart displays variant_label
- Simple product (no options) still uses default variant transparently
- Delete option type → all variants deactivated (not deleted, preserves order history)
- Admin frontend: Variants tab (option CRUD, generate button, SKU/active table)
- Admin frontend: Inventory page uses variant picker
- Storefront: variant picker dropdowns on product page; cart shows variant label
- Migration script (`scripts/migrate_variants.py`) tested: creates new tables, adds columns, recreates warehouse_stock and cart_items with correct schema, creates default variants for all existing products

**Two bugs found and fixed during testing:**
- `generate_variants`: re-generate crashed (500) because matched existing variants lacked loaded relations — fixed by loading full chain in initial query
- `migrate_variants.py`: used wrong engine import name, failed to import models before `create_all`, missing ALTER TABLE steps, and needed table recreation for NOT NULL constraint removal

### Sprints 4–7 comprehensive test (2026-06-27)
All 33 "Built, not tested" backlog items tested end-to-end via 112 live API tests (all pass).

**Shipping zones:** Create/update/delete zones (countries as string), rate calculation by country code.

**Rate limiting:** 429 returned after 5+ failed login attempts per minute from same IP.

**RFQ plugin:** Customer creates draft → submits → admin marks as under review.

**Credit plugin:** Admin creates account with limit, customer views balance, admin updates limit, DELETE account, credit used on checkout is restored after admin cancel.

**Inventory:** Create warehouse (requires `code` field), set/adjust stock per variant, low-stock threshold detection, DELETE non-default warehouse.

**Wishlist:** Add product (URL route `POST /api/wishlist/{product_id}`), list, remove.

**Newsletter:** Subscribe, admin list/update/delete subscribers, CSV export.

**Addresses:** Save default address, list, update label.

**Discount rules:** Create rule, GET single, list all.

**Loyalty:** Admin list all accounts, customer views own balance, points earned on order, points reversed after admin cancel.

**Coupons:** Homepage enforcement — server ensures only one `show_on_homepage=True` at a time (fixed: `CouponCreate` and `CouponUpdate` now include `show_on_homepage` field, create enforces uniqueness). DELETE coupon.

**Orders (full flow):** Checkout via `POST /api/checkout` (not `/checkout/place`), `shipping_address` is a plain string, payment methods are `cash`/`credit_limit`/`stripe`. Admin delivers (`PUT /status`), admin cancels → credit restored and loyalty reversed.

**Reviews:** Only customers with a delivered order for that product can submit. Approve via `PATCH /api/reviews/{id}/approve`. Author edit re-queues for approval.

**Order tracking:** `PATCH /api/orders/{id}/fulfil` sets tracking number and marks shipped. Customer sees tracking number.

**CSV exports:** Orders and Products CSVs return content correctly.

**Product duplicate finder:** Endpoint returns list/dict (no duplicates in test data).

**Media upload:** Upload PNG via `POST /api/media/upload`, returns URL.

**Seven bugs found and fixed during testing:**
- `orders.shipping_cost` column missing from DB — added via targeted migration
- `shipping` plugin not in `ENABLED_PLUGINS` — added
- `shipping_zones` table not created — created via `create_all`
- `CouponCreate`/`CouponUpdate` missing `show_on_homepage` field — added to schemas and service
- Wishlist remove: missing `await db.flush()` after `db.delete(item)` — added
- Cart items returning 409 when `product.stock_quantity = 0` — test now filters for in-stock products
- Checkout response field is `order_id` not `id` — test fixed

**Items intentionally not API-tested (require special setup):**
- Stripe refund — no Stripe test credentials
- Backup cron — Docker only
- AI chat — no OPENROUTER_API_KEY
- Analytics charts — UI charts, no dedicated data endpoint
- SEO meta tags — requires browser/`<head>` inspection
- GDPR consent banner — localStorage-based, frontend only

### Full app verification + bug fixes (2026-06-29)

Comprehensive live test of every plugin and every user-facing flow. All items below confirmed working end-to-end.

**Storefront flows tested:**
- Home page, product listing, product detail (with and without variants)
- Category filter via top nav (by `category_id`) and sidebar
- Add to cart → update quantity → remove; cart persists across page navigation
- Guest checkout (cash, GB shipping applied correctly)
- Coupon code validation (`GET /api/coupons/validate?code=X&subtotal=N`)
- User registration → login → account page
- Wishlist: add, list, remove
- Password show/hide toggle on all password fields (login, register, reset, account, trade)
- Trade account application form
- Newsletter subscribe
- Contact form submit
- AI chat widget renders correctly; shows graceful error when no API key is set

**Admin flows tested:**
- Product CRUD (create, PUT update, delete); new product appears in storefront immediately
- Category CRUD
- Branding config GET and PUT
- Order list, detail, status update (PUT)
- Coupon CRUD and homepage featured coupon
- Discount rules CRUD
- Inventory warehouses and stock
- Loyalty config and account list
- Announcements CRUD (create, list, active public endpoint, delete)
- Reviews admin list
- RFQ submit and admin list
- Credit admin account management
- Addresses CRUD
- Shipping zones (admin) and rate calculation (public)
- User admin list

**Per-variant pricing (2026-06-29) — promoted from "Built, not tested":**
- Admin: set price adjustment on variant → saves → reloads correctly
- Storefront product page: selecting a variant updates the displayed price live
- Cart and checkout: adjusted price used in line totals and order total
- Storefront product detail page loads with correct product name in SSR HTML

**Bugs found and fixed (commits 9dad65d, ccab0c5):**
- Top nav category links used `cat.slug` → now use `cat.id` (products were never filtered)
- `EditProductPage` declared `async` in a `"use client"` file → fixed with `React.use(props.params)`
- `ImageUpload` posted to relative `/api/media/upload` → now posts to absolute backend URL
- CORS origins missing `localhost:3000` and `localhost:3001` → added to `.env`
- `ENVIRONMENT=production` in dev `.env` → refresh cookie had `Secure` flag, blocking localhost auth
- `announcements` plugin missing from `ENABLED_PLUGINS` and no DB table → migration added, plugin enabled
- Auto discount rules with `discount_value < 0` were adding a surcharge to every order total → bad seed data deleted; `evaluate_rules()` now filters negative values and invalid types at the DB query
- Loyalty admin page showed "Points per Dollar" / "$" labels on a GBP store → fixed to "Points per £1" / "£"
- 4 duplicate "10% off over £50" discount rules left over from testing → deleted

**Configuration items (not code bugs):**
- AI chat returns 503 until `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set in `.env` — handled gracefully by chat widget
- Stripe payment method returns 503 until `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set — correct behaviour

### Admin search + pagination (2026-07-01)

Search and pagination added to all 7 admin list pages. 200/200 backend tests pass (including 29 new pagination tests).

**Backend changes (all endpoints now return `{ items, total, page, page_size, pages }`):**
- `GET /api/auth/users` — paginated with `page`/`page_size` query params
- `GET /api/newsletter/subscribers` — paginated (CSV export unchanged, uses separate service function)
- `GET /api/reviews/admin/all` — paginated; `is_approved` filter now server-side
- `GET /api/contact` — paginated
- `GET /api/rfq` — `pages` field was missing from `RFQPageOut` schema — fixed

**Frontend changes (all admin list pages):**
- `components/ui/pagination.tsx` — shared Prev/Next pagination component (only renders when > 1 page)
- `lib/types.ts` — `Paginated<T>` generic interface added
- Products: search input with 300ms debounce + pagination; search resets to page 1
- Orders: pagination (was silently ignoring `?limit=50`; now correctly uses `?page=N`)
- RFQ: pagination (same fix as orders)
- Users, Newsletter, Reviews, Enquiries: pagination added to all four

**Pre-existing bug fixed:** `db.delete(product)` in `products/service.py` was missing `await` — caused `test_delete_duplicates_keeps_selected` to fail.

**Playwright E2E tests written** (`frontend-admin/e2e/pagination.spec.ts`, 16 specs):
- Products: search filtering, empty-result state, clearing search, search resets page
- Products: pagination Prev/Next navigation, disabled states, page counter
- Enquiries: pagination Prev/Next
- Newsletter: pagination, filter toggle resets to page 1
- No-data: pagination hidden when < 20 records

**To run E2E tests:** start backend on `:8000` and admin on `:3001`, then `npm run test:e2e` from `frontend-admin/`.

### Component library sprint (2026-06-28)

Blocks directory reorganised into four categories (layout / visual / commerce / content). 8 new block components added. Variant picker refactored from `<select>` dropdowns to pill buttons.

**Directory reorganisation:**
- All 22 existing blocks moved into `components/blocks/layout/`, `visual/`, `commerce/`, `content/` subdirectories.
- Registry keys unchanged — no config JSON changes needed.

**8 new blocks registered in block-registry.ts and block-defaults.ts (storefront + admin):**
- `glassmorphism-hero` — full-bleed image with frosted-glass card overlay
- `parallax-banner` — fixed-background parallax banner with CTA
- `marquee-ticker` — continuously scrolling trust signals strip
- `gradient-text-section` — impact statement with CSS gradient heading text
- `image-mosaic` — staggered image grid (up to 6 images, alternating tall/short)
- `split-image-text` — two-column image + text layout, image side configurable
- `animated-counter` — stats row that counts up on scroll into view (uses framer-motion)
- `bento-grid` — asymmetric card grid with one large feature card + smaller cards

**Variant picker refactor:**
- `app/products/[slug]/variant-picker.tsx` — replaced `<select>` dropdowns with pill buttons; out-of-stock values shown as greyed strikethrough pills (still clickable); `aria-pressed` + `role="group"` for accessibility.
- `app/products/[slug]/add-to-cart-button.tsx` — button shows "Out of stock" and disables when selected combination maps to an inactive variant; picker stays mounted so selections are preserved.
- OOS pill detection is per-combination: selecting one option greys out values in other groups that would form an inactive combination. Per-combination narrowing shipped and tested 2026-06-29.

**Admin block-defaults sync:** 3 previously missing entries (`promotions-banner`, `announcement-bar`, `coupon-spotlight`) added to `frontend-admin/lib/block-defaults.ts`.

### Bug review + storefront/admin fixes (2026-07-04)

Full-codebase bug review documented in `docs/bugs-log.md` (13 findings + verified-clean areas). Fixes made this session:

**Built + Tested (automated — `backend/tests/test_storefront_fixes.py`, 11 tests; new cart E2E; suite now 211 passing):**
- **Branding config save** — `social_links` type mismatch caused HTTP 422 on *every* save; now accepts empty/JSON/invalid strings, and save failures surface an error instead of failing silently. (commit `a1b97dc`)
- **Add-to-cart from listings (bug F8)** — product grid / featured / wishlist passed a *product* id where a *variant* id was expected, so nothing was added while the card still flashed "Added!". Cart API now accepts `product_id` and resolves the product's default variant; listings honor the result. New E2E asserts the item actually lands in the cart. (commit `41b35bf`)
- **Product list API returns `description`** — homepage "quick reference" table now shows real category + description instead of "—" (bug F15). (commit `d0fad8b`)
- **Checkout discount API dependencies** — coupon-validate amount and loyalty-config rate covered by tests.

**Built, not tested (needs manual browser check):**
- **Admin Products page** — image thumbnail column (valid / grey "no image" / red "broken URL" states) to spot wrong or missing product images; **"Featured" checkbox** added to the new + edit product forms (backend already supported `is_featured`; only the UI was missing). (commit `f1406b0`)
- **Homepage now honors the Featured flag** — was querying the wrong param (`is_featured` instead of `featured_only`), so it ignored featured products; now shows real product images in the hero + grids (bugs F12–F14), tops up featured with other active products so both grids stay filled, and uses honest section headings (bug F16). (commits `66ae4c6`, `d0fad8b`)
- **Checkout order summary** now shows coupon + loyalty discount lines and a correct total (bug F9 display maths); **wishlist toggle** shows a clear failure state (bug F11). (commit `d0fad8b`)
- Fixed a pre-existing type error in `product-search-combobox.tsx`.

**Security + payment fixes (done 2026-07-04, tested):**
- **B4 (HIGH, security) — FIXED:** role changes via `PATCH /api/auth/users/{id}` now require superadmin, so an admin can no longer escalate itself/anyone to superadmin. (`tests/test_security_fixes.py`)
- **B5 (MED, security) — FIXED:** password change/reset now revokes all of the user's refresh tokens, so existing sessions can't be refreshed afterward. (`tests/test_security_fixes.py`)
- **B1 (HIGH) — FIXED:** Stripe stock/coupon/loyalty effects are deferred to the `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook (cash/credit still synchronous), so an abandoned card checkout no longer oversells stock or consumes coupons/points. (`tests/test_checkout_deferral.py`)
- **B8 (MED) — FIXED:** cancelling an order now reverses coupon usage (customer + admin paths). (`tests/test_order_lifecycle.py`)
- **B9 (MED) — FIXED:** `update_status` now rejects illegal transitions (cancelled/delivered are terminal). (`tests/test_order_lifecycle.py`)
- **B2 (MED) — FIXED:** explicit-items checkout now resolves the variant (explicit or default), applies its price adjustment, and records `variant_id`. (`tests/test_explicit_checkout.py`)
- **B6 — FIXED:** coupons are now one redemption per customer (authenticated). (`tests/test_coupon_per_user.py`)
- **B7 — FIXED:** email verification required — unverified customers are blocked from login (behind `REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION`, default on), with a resend-verification flow. (`tests/test_email_verification.py`)

**All review findings B1–B9 are now fixed except B3 (deferred). `docs/bugs-log.md` is the detailed record.**

### VPS stability fixes + per-client currency (2026-07-05)

**Built + Tested (automated):**
- **SQLite concurrency hang** — engine now uses WAL + busy_timeout (backend was wedging under the superadmin's setup activity, needing a restart). (`tests/test_stability_fixes.py`)
- **`COOKIE_SECURE` setting** — refresh cookie Secure flag is configurable so HTTP-only deployments work. (`tests/test_stability_fixes.py`)
- **Admin category list `include_empty`** — imported categories now show in admin before products exist. (`tests/test_stability_fixes.py`)
- **Per-client currency** — `CURRENCY_CODE` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_CURRENCY_CODE` (default GBP) drives price symbols + Stripe charge currency + order emails. Backend fully unit-tested (symbols, format, Stripe, email); storefront price rendering covered by E2E. (`tests/test_currency.py`, `frontend-starter/e2e/currency.spec.ts`)

**Built, NOT tested — needs manual browser verification:**
- **Login-error display fix** — admin/storefront login now shows the real error instead of flashing + reloading (api.ts no longer runs refresh-redirect on `/api/auth/*`). *tsc-clean only; verify a wrong-password login keeps the message on screen.*
- **Media library "Copy URL" over HTTP** — clipboard fallback for non-secure contexts. *Verify copy works on the VPS (HTTP) — no automated test.*
- **Currency in a non-GBP deployment** — only the GBP default is E2E-tested. *Deploy one client with `CURRENCY_CODE=USD` (or similar) and confirm the storefront + admin show the right symbol and Stripe charges in that currency.*
- **Admin currency labels** — Credit/Loyalty/Discount/Shipping/Products label symbols were bulk-replaced; tsc-clean but not visually reviewed per page.
- **Frontend `formatMoney` unit logic** — no JS unit-test runner is set up (only Playwright). Logic mirrors the tested backend `format_money`; a vitest setup would close this gap.

**Deploy note:** currency is build-time — set `CURRENCY_CODE` in the root `.env`, then rebuild the frontends (`docker compose build frontend-starter frontend-admin`). HTTP deploys also need `COOKIE_SECURE=false`. See `docs/new-client-setup.md`.

## Not built — Priority 4 (medium, plan before building)

| ID | Feature | Notes |
|----|---------|-------|
| P | 2FA for admin | TOTP flow, QR setup, backup codes. Separate sprint. |
| R | Per-client git branch script | `scripts/new-client.sh` to automate `git checkout -b client-name` + seed template copy |
| S | Bulk image assignment via product CSV | Add optional `image_url` column to product import CSV; on import, create a `ProductImage` record linked to the product. Allows full product setup (including hero image) in one CSV upload without clicking through each product. |
| V | Repair the Alembic migration chain | `alembic upgrade head` fails on a fresh DB (`no such table: product_variants`) — the variant tables were added via `create_all`, never in a migration, but `c8d9e0f1a2b3` alters them. Workaround in place: `init_db.py` (create_all from models) + `alembic stamp head`; documented in `docs/new-client-setup.md`. Proper fix: author a migration that creates the variant tables (product_variants, product_option_types/values, product_variant_options) and recreates cart_items/warehouse_stock with `variant_id`, slotted before `c8d9e0f1a2b3`, so `alembic upgrade head` works end-to-end. |
| U | Consolidate stock to one source of truth (B3) | Checkout uses only `Product.stock_quantity`; the per-variant `WarehouseStock` system is built but never wired into selling (`deduct_stock_for_variant`/`get_variant_stock_total` are unused). Decide based on need: single pool → keep product-level authoritative and retire/relabel the warehouse feature; multi-warehouse → make warehouse authoritative and derive the shop's stock. Deferred pending the multi-warehouse decision. |
| T | Eliminate frontend/backend type duplication | The frontends keep hand-written type mirrors (`frontend-starter/lib/types.ts`, `frontend-admin/lib/types.ts`) that silently drift from the backend Pydantic schemas — the cause of several 2026-07-04 bugs (`primary_image` vs `images[]`, missing `description`/`is_featured`). Fix: add an automated drift-check (CI/pre-commit runs `gen:types` and fails if `types.ts` is stale) and/or true codegen so frontend types are derived, not hand-kept; also add a `gen:types` script to the admin app (it currently has none). Process documented in `docs/type-sync.md`. |

## Not built — Product variants v2 (remaining items)

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| ~~Variant picker — per-combination OOS narrowing~~ | **Done** — shipped 2026-06-29. Pills narrow based on current selections across all option groups. |
| ~~Variant images~~ | **Built, not tested** — `variant_id` on `ProductImage`; admin dropdown to assign images to variants; storefront auto-switches main image when variant selected. Migration: `e2f3a4b5c6d7`. |
| ~~Bulk variant import via CSV~~ | **Built, not tested** — global CSV format, two stock modes (set/add), per-row error reporting, export round-trip. 46 automated tests pass. Admin UI at /bulk-variants. Needs manual browser smoke test. |
| ~~Warehouse-to-warehouse stock transfers at variant level~~ | **Built, not tested** — `POST /api/inventory/transfers`, atomic deduct+credit, dest auto-created, 24 tests pass. Transfer Stock card on inventory page. Needs manual browser test. |

---

## Not built — Priority 5 (HTTPS activation, blocks live clients)

HTTPS is not blocking development but IS required before any client goes live.

**Preparatory work is already done:**
- `nginx/default.conf` — nginx config with HTTP → HTTPS redirect and SSL block
- `nginx/entrypoint.sh` — envsubst startup script
- Section 12 of `docs/new-client-setup.md` — complete step-by-step instructions (certbot, DNS, port changes)
- `docker-compose.yml` has the nginx and certbot service definitions, commented out

**What to do when a client is ready for a live domain:**
1. Get the domain name from the client
2. Point DNS A record to the VPS IP
3. Follow `docs/new-client-setup.md` Section 12 exactly (all commands are there)

---

## Intentionally deferred (not planned for now)

### Security / Infrastructure (ops responsibility)
- `SECRET_KEY` — randomly generated per deployment, never committed
- `DATABASE_URL` — SQLite for dev only; PostgreSQL required for production at scale
- `SMTP_*` — per-client email provider, set at deploy time
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — per-client billing, never committed to git
- `CORS_ORIGINS` — depends on hosting domain, set at deploy time

### Backend
- **Media upload: magic bytes check** — `content_type` is client-supplied and can be spoofed; real fix requires `python-magic`; accepted trade-off for internal tool
- **Admin credentials in seed.py** — `admin@commerceforce.dev / Admin1234!` hardcoded; must be changed before any real deployment

### Frontend / Admin
- **Image management** — **Built and tested (API)** — Media Library supports folder-based organisation (`/uploads/folder/filename.jpg`), grouped display, folder input on upload, and delete. Docker bind-mounted to `./uploads/`. 21 API tests pass (upload, list, delete, overwrite, path traversal, static serving, directory listing blocked). Browser UI still needs manual verification.
- **Product barcode + multi-image** — **Built and tested (API)** — `barcode` field added end-to-end (DB, migration, schemas, CSV import/export with injection guard, both admin forms). Admin create page now has full multi-image panel. Storefront card uses `is_primary` image as thumbnail. 15 API tests pass. Browser UI still needs manual verification.
- **Product CSV image columns** — **Built and tested (API)** — `image_url_1`–`image_url_5` columns in product CSV import and export. `image_url_1` = primary. Any column filled → full image replacement; all blank → existing images untouched. 24 API tests pass (7 scenarios). Also fixed pre-existing `await db.delete()` bug in service.py.
- **WCAG contrast validation** — no automated check that brand colours meet WCAG AA; manual check required
- **Font via next/font/google** — config `"brand.font"` injects a runtime Google Fonts link tag (works); for peak performance also update the `next/font/google` import in `layout.tsx` and rebuild

### Developer experience
- **CI/CD pipeline** — out of scope until product is ready for market
- **`ENABLED_PLUGINS` / config divergence** — frontend reads config `"plugins"` list; backend reads `.env`; if they diverge, a block appears but its API returns 404 (handled gracefully)
- **Visual preview tool** — live preview of `landing-page.config.json` without running full dev stack
- **Component library builder** — systematic process for sourcing new block components; currently ad-hoc
